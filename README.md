# Preliminary work exploring retail brand association and proximity
This repository contains my project proposal picked as a finalist for The Data Incubator Fellowship. It studies retail brands by association and proximity. This preliminary work looks at 2 aspects of brand association:
1. What top retail brands are located close together
2. At what rate customers move between different brand locations
